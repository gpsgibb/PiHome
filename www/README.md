# Website to show status and any data from a Raspberry Pi

This website displays a Pi's status, allows its home directory to be browsed and allows any data collected by its sensors (using the code in ../utils/logs.py) to be displayed.

The website uses the flask python framework.

Todo:
 - Have the site return sensor data through an API
 - Implement some of the functionality of site with javascript, as it's currently all html/CSS and all the smarts are in the backend
