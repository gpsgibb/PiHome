# Website to show status and any data from a Raspberry Pi

This website displays a Pi's status, allows its home filesystem to be browsed and allows any data from it to be displayed. At present, this only works for "TempHum" data from a DHT sensor, as seen in the clock.py application, but I plan to extend this to other datatypes later.

The website uses the flask python framework.
