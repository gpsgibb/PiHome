# PiHome
Code for my DIY Raspberry Pi based smart home system

Currently a work in progress, but the plan is to have a number of Raspberry
Pis about my flat recording data (temperature, humidity, electricity/gas/water
usage etc...) which will be available in a central place. I also have plans
for creating a smart-thermostat using a raspberry pi, in addition to a smart
bedside clock.

Currently I have written some classes for reading from sensors, and
interfacing with various chips (analogue to digital converter, shift register
etc...).
