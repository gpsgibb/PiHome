A C code for reading a DHT 11/22 sensor. It can also be used as a python 
module.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

- To compile the code for use as a standalone executable, type "sudo make C"

- To compile the code for use as a python module, type "sudo make python" 

- To compile for both uses, type "sudo make all"

USAGE:

- Standalone executable:
  Run ./DHT [GPIO Pin number] [Sensor class (22 or 11)]

- Python module:
  From within Python, do:
  >>> import DHTC
  >>> result = DHTC.read(PinNum,class)
  >>> if (result["status"] == 0:
  ...    print result["Temperature"]
  ...    print result["Humidity"]
      else:
         print "There was some read error"
